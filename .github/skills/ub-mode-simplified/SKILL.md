# ub-mode

Every time you are asked to make a change follow:
- First Make it Work.
- Then Make it Right.
- Follow Practice.

# First Make it Work

## Laziness Protocol

- One decision lives in one place.
- Ship the smallest edit that solves the problem.

## Foundational Thinking

- Get the data shape right before you write the logic.
- Do first whatever helps every later phase.
- If a concurrent writer would matter, do not share state.

## Verification & Sanity

- Do not write new tests by default unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Verify changes by inspecting logic, contracts, and running existing test suites.
- If reproducing an obscure bug, verify via reproduction steps or minimal isolated script before editing.

## Redesign From First Principles

- Do not bolt a new requirement onto the old design.
- Ask what you would have built if it had been there from the start, think that through, and deliver it in pieces.

## Attack the Premise

- When two fixes that share one premise fail the same gate, write that premise in one sentence and count which actors hold the imbalance.
- Remove the assignment.
- Do not start another fix until you have done that.

## Subtract Before You Add

- Take complexity out before you add anything.

## Outcome-Oriented Execution

- Aim at the end state you can check.
- A break in the middle is allowed when you planned it and can undo it.

## Build the Lever

- If the work is not obvious at a glance, build the tool that does it.
- Do one unit by hand, then make the tool match that unit.

## Architecture

### Model the Domain

- Put the domain in a structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable.
- Maintain a glossary of domain terms.
- If the code is already clear and local, leave it.

### Boundary Discipline

- Check the data where it enters.
- Inside, trust it.
- Keep the business logic in a pure function.

### Type System Discipline

- Make the illegal value impossible to write.
- Parse outside data once, where it comes in.
- Do not silence the compiler or type checker.

### Make Operations Idempotent

- Running it twice, or running it after a crash halfway through, ends in the same state.

### Separate Before Serializing Shared State

- If they do not need the same mutable thing, give each its own.
- If they do, allow one writer, and enforce that in the structure.

# Then Make it Right

## Fix Root Causes

- Reproduce it.
- Fix the cause.
- A guard that only hides the crash is not a fix.

## Sequence Work into Verifiable Units

- Finish one small unit and check it.
- Then start the next.

## Complexity Control

- Keep cyclomatic complexity low.
- Split functions when branches and responsibilities multiply.
- Prefer early exits and pattern matching over deep nesting.

## Deduplication

- Eliminate obvious structural and logic duplication where a shared helper clarifies intent.
- Do not create speculative abstractions for coincidental similarity.

## Dead Code Elimination

- Delete dead, unreachable, and commented-out code immediately.
- Remove unused parameters, imports, and variables.

## Refactoring

- Pin what the code does.
- Change the structure.
- Prove the behavior did not change using static analysis, linter checks, and existing tests.

# Practice

## Keep a Log

- Keep a log of every action you take and the reason you took it.
- Report that log upon completion.

## Guard the Context Window

- Keep the main thread small.
- Send the bulk elsewhere, and keep the summary.

## Worktree Cleanup

- Find what is safe to remove, confirm nothing still in use needs it, then reclaim the disk.
- Uncommitted work waits for a decision.
